# Account-Wide
Transfer data between all of your characters
  - All non-bot accounts are combined, so you can share between multiple accounts if you want to have more than 10 characters
  - Transfers can be run for bot accounts in addition to yours if the option is selected
    - You will not receive any achievements, pets, etc. from bot accounts and vice versa

## Achievements

### Rewards

  - Faction specific rewards are converted depending on each character's faction
  - All item rewards will be sent to each character's mailbox
  - Running this transfer will restore cut titles to the world database, including Realm First titles and "the Flawless Victor"
  - Feats of Strength that don't explicitly reward titles yet are title related (Vanilla PVP titles, "Scarab Lord", etc.) will give each character the title

## Reputations
https://github.com/DominicMonares/spp-extras/assets/78285106/fb9db23e-1e6d-48f4-8d89-a5bca5f5dbd4

- The highest current standing for each reputation is shared between all characters
- Faction specific reputations do not get shared (i.e. Horde characters won't get Stormwind rep)
  - Faction specific standings are **not** converted to their opposing faction equivalents
- "At War" flags will not be applied unless all characters are at war with that reputation/faction
- Counts toward Exalted Reputations (5 - 40) achievement chain

# Quest Tracker
Track the completion status of all quests

https://github.com/DominicMonares/spp-extras/assets/78285106/a287fd1a-92e5-4f7a-ad8c-19a6e67de800

- Completed quests are marked with green circles and incomplete quests with red circles
- Quests can be sorted by name, ID, or completion status

## Primary Filters
  - Quests are always filtered by either Alliance or Horde
    - Neutral quests are always included
  - At least one of the following options must be selected to view quests:
    - Zone
      - Filter by world, dungeon, raid, or battleground quests
    - Class
    - Race
    - All Quests 

## Secondary Filters
  - After a primary filter is selected, you can selected the following secondary filters:
    - Character
      - Shows quest completion status for the selected character
    - Quest Type
      - Filter by regular, daily, weekly, or monthly quests

# Warnings & Limitations:
  - Account-Wide data transfers are irreversible, making a backup of your game save/database through the SPP Classics launcher before running any transfers is **STRONGLY** recommended
  - Your characters must be logged out before running transfers for them to work properly
  - Transfers only work on characters that have logged in at least once since being created
  - If your alts are logged in as bots, any achievement progress they make will count toward shared progress
  - Mounts that are above a character's riding skill level are not given to that character on transfer, you will need to re-run the transfer once they have the appropriate riding skill to transfer those mounts to them
  - Retrieving achievement item rewards from your characters' mail boxes immediately after transfer is **strongly** recommended, in order to reduce the risk of mail being lost
  - Due to how the following achievement chains track progress, in-game progress counters for them do not update properly when new progress is earned and won't reflect the true total until after the transfer is run:
    - Quests Complete (50 - 3,000)
    - Honorable Kills (100 - 100,000)
  - Deleting a character will remove most of their progress from your account-wide achievement progress
    - If you want to delete a character to make space, but want to keep their account-wide progress, I recommend creating a second account and moving that character to the second account using an editor like HeidiSQL
      - Get the newly created account ID from classicrealmd/tbcrealmd/wotlkrealmd > account
      - Find the character you planned to delete in classiccharacters/tbccharacters/wotlkcharacters > characters
      - Change their current account ID to the newly created account ID

[Celguar's SPP Classics Repack](https://github.com/celguar/spp-classics-cmangos) is CMaNGOS based, so this program will likely work with other CMaNGOS based repacks or forks.

If testing with a repack or fork other than [Celguar's SPP Classics Repack](https://github.com/celguar/spp-classics-cmangos), be sure to make a database backup and check src/main/db/connection.ts to ensure database credentials are correct.
